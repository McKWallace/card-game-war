## Project Choice (Tell us which project you're doing!)
>The Card Game War
    >>(If I have time left, I want to complete the 'Magic 8 Ball-Fortune Teller' idea for fun!)

## Project Description
>War is a card game where two cards played face up, with the higher valued card winning and thus belonging then to the user with the winning card. 
>The goal of the game is for one player to have all the cards by the end of the game.

## User Stories
>As a player, I want to see two cards displayed with how many cards each player has.
>As a player, I want to see two cards to know which card has the higher value to win.
>As a player, I want to have all the cards to know that I won the game.
>As a player, I want to "battle" when both cards are the same. This means flipping over another card and seeing who wins. We do this until there is a winner.

>As a player, I would like to choose the color of the decks.
>As a player, I would like to choose the color of my own deck.
>As a player, I would like to play without someone else. (via the computer)
>As a player, I would like to have the option to have the game last only 3 mins, 5 mins, 10 mins, original winning logic.
>As a player, I would like to enter my name and have it displayed (along with displayed with the score

## MVP Goals
>Will have 2 players and two stacks of cards displayed.
>Higher valued card wins, both cards in play return to the winner's deck.
>Lower valued cards lose, player loses card to winner.
>Loss of card will decrease player's deck.
>Win will increase the player's deck.
>Player will activate (click or keyboard?) deck to choose the next card in play.
>Cards will be compared to determine higher value.
>If value is the same, a "battle" scenario will happen. Players will flip another card to determine who will take all 4 cards present will happen until a winner is decided.
>Game continues until ONE player has won all cards over.
>Display card count for each player

## Stretch Goals
>When in "battle" players will have three face-down cards pulled before flipping their next card. The winner will receive all 8 cards if their 2nd face up draw falls into the winning requirements.
>Color Changes
    >>Part 1 - Choose the coloring of the decks (both).
    >>Part 2 - Choose the coloring of the decks (for each player).
>Ability to enter the players names before the beginning of the game. This is to display over the desk of cards.
>To choose the length of the game in minutes instead of playing until the end of the deck or one user is out of cards.
>Able to choose the design on the deck of cards.
